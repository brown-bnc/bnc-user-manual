# ironmap

Ironmap is a script that receives preprocessed 3D+Time fMRI data and outputs one volume, where the value of each voxel is the inverse of the normalized T2\* measurement. 1/T2\* can be used to quantify intracellular iron (ferritin) and is particularly useful in the study of dopaminergic systems in the brain.

You can find the ironmap bash script (ironmap.sh) either in the BNC scripts directory on Oscar (`/oscar/data/bnc/scripts`) or on [github](https://github.com/brown-bnc/oscar-scripts/blob/main/ironmap.sh).&#x20;
