# Getting Started

If this is your first time using XNAT, here is a short outline of things you'll need to do!

### 1. Create an account using your Brown Credentials

{% content-ref url="accessing-xnat.md" %}
[accessing-xnat.md](accessing-xnat.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 2. Work with the MRF on your scan protocol and choosing a project name

{% hint style="success" %}
We will match the naming of your scan protocol and your XNAT project so that your data automatically ends up in the right place after your scan
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you will be using our XNAT to BIDS conversion tools, your sequences on the scanner should be named in a ["BIDS Ready" format](bids-compliant-protocols.md). The BNC is happy to work with you to figure out the appropriate naming for your sequences.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Contact us to request a new XNAT project&#x20;

{% content-ref url="project-creation-in-xnat.md" %}
[project-creation-in-xnat.md](project-creation-in-xnat.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 3. Collect your data and send to XNAT

At the scanner, once your scan is complete, export your data to XNAT. &#x20;

{% content-ref url="uploading-data.md" %}
[uploading-data.md](uploading-data.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are collecting multi-session data, follow [these instructions](uploading-data.md#naming-for-multi-session-studies) to add a session label to your subject ID. This will allow XNAT to organize your data properly and avoid conflicts. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 4. Check that ALL your data has been received and it is complete

Try your best to check the integrity of your data within a day. While it may take an hour or so for your data to appear on XNAT, it should not take longer than half a day. If you have not received your data, or anything looks strange, [contact us](../#contact-us)!
