# Getting Started

If this is your first time using XNAT, here is a short outline of things you'll need to do!



### 1. Create an account using your Brown Credentials

{% content-ref url="accessing-xnat.md" %}
[accessing-xnat.md](accessing-xnat.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a project is created before you have created your account, access to your data may be delayed
{% endhint %}

### 2. Work with the MRF on your protocol and a project name that is compatible with our set up

{% hint style="warning" %}
All project names must follow our set up for automated data routing
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="managing-your-projects.md" %}
[managing-your-projects.md](managing-your-projects.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you will be working with BIDS, then the naming of your sequences must follow our recommendations
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="bids-compliant-protocols.md" %}
[bids-compliant-protocols.md](bids-compliant-protocols.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 3. Collect your data and send to XNATRELAY

At the scanner, send your collected data to XNATRELAY. This is an intermediate destination to guarantee data encryption during transfer. Your data will automatically be sent within a couple of hours.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="uploading-data.md" %}
[uploading-data.md](uploading-data.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 4. Check that ALL your data has been received and it is complete

Try your best to check the integrity of your data within a day. While it may take a couple of hours, it should not take longer than half a day. If you have not received your data, [contact us](../#contact-us)!
