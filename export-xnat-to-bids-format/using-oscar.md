# Exporting to BIDS using Oscar

## Interacting with Oscar

You can login to Oscar via different methods. You can [ssh using your terminal](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/ssh), you can [connect via a VNC \(Virtual Desktop\) Client](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/vnc), or if your editor can connect to remote servers, [you can connect via your favorite IDE](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/remote-ide). If this is your first time using Oscar and you are new to unix command line, we recommend connecting via the VNC client.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you connect to Oscar via SSH, you arrive at a login node, we wil need to wrap our commands in a batch file or use an interactive session. You can learn more about running jobs in the Oscar [docs](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/submitting-jobs/shared-machine). Please **remember to not run processing on the login nodes**

## Installating XNAT2BIDS

**ðŸŽ‰ Skip -** You will not need to install any software. We keep a Singularity image of the most recent tagged release of [`xnat-tools`](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools)in Oscar. If this is the first time that you here the word `Singularity image` don't worry, we will expand more on that soon.

## Running XNAT2BIDS

The xnat-tools package provides a convenience `xnat2bids` script to facilitate data export and conversion to BIDS. The script is documented [here](https://brown-bnc.github.io/xnat-tools/1.0.0/xnat2bids/), and the package documentation is useful for knowing the the full list of inputs and defaults. We will demostrate how to call that script within Oscar using the BNC's demo dataset. 

### Start an Interactive session

Here we start the software as an **interactive** job of one hour.

#### Login into oscar and start an interactive section by typing

```text
interact -n 2 -t 01:00:00 -m 8g
```

#### Specify the version of `xnat-tools` to

```text
version=v1.0.5
```

####  Set up paths

Set up the working directory in Oscar, usually `/gpfs/data/<your PI's group>`. We pass \(bind\) this path to singularity so that it can access/see it

```text
data_dir=/gpfs/data/bnc
```

Output directory. It has to be under the data\_dir, otherwise it won't be seen by singularity. It also needs to be created \(unless it already exists\)

```text
bids_root_dir=${data_dir}/shared/bids-export/${USER}
mkdir -m 775 ${bids_root_dir} || echo "Output directory already exists"
```

Path to Singularity Image for xnat-tools \(maintained by bnc\)

```text
simg=/gpfs/data/bnc/simgs/brownbnc/xnat-tools-${version}.sif
```

#### Define XNAT 

```text
XNAT_USER="youruser" #change to a valid user
XNAT_SESSION="XNAT3_E04441" #change to a valid session
```

#### Run the main executable via singularity

The following command runs xnat2bids \(via singularity\) command to extract DICOMs from xnat and export to BIDS. The command tells singularity to launch `xnat-tools-${version}.sif` image and execute the `xnat2bids` command with the given inputs. The `-B ${data_dir}` makes the `data_dir` directory available to the singularity container. The `-i` is asking to only process the first sequence. For a full list of inputs, please see the [xnat-tools documentation](https://brown-bnc.github.io/xnat-tools/1.0.0/xnat2bids/)

```text
singularity exec --contain -B ${data_dir} ${simg} \
    xnat2bids ${XNAT_SESSION} ${bids_root_dir} \
    -u ${XNAT_USER} \
    -i 1
```
