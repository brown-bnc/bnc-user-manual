# Introduction

The BNC has collected a demo dataset that is available to the community for learning how to use our tools and processing scripts. While this dataset contains typical sequences, it is not exhaustive and the best sequences for your study may differ. These sequences are examples, not recommendations. Our hope is that this data set will be useful for understanding how protocols appear on the scanner console, for understanding how data appears when it is transferred to XNAT, and for learning how to access and export data from XNAT in a variety of formats, including BIDS.

Note: If you've used the BNC's demo dataset in the past, you may notice that things look different now. Starting in 2025 we began collecting a second demo dataset (called Demodat2), which includes additional sequences and updated protocol parameters. It also includes physiological data which was acquired during scanning. It was also collected on our Siemens scanner after upgrading it to XA30, which means the dicom files are now in the newer "enhanced dicom" format.&#x20;

Demodat (version 1) is still available to download on XNAT, but the tutorials in this user manual are now updated to reference Demodat2.&#x20;
