# Introduction

BNC is actively working on collecting a dataset that is available to the communitiy for learning how to use our tools and processing scripts. While this dataset contains typical sequences, it is not exhaustive and the best sequences for your study may differ. These sequences are examples, not recommendations.  Our hope is that this data set will be useful for understanding how protocols appear on the scanner console, for understanding how data appears when it is transferred to XNAT, for learning how to access and export data from XNAT in a variety of formats, including BIDS.
