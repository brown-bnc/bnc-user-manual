BNC's demo dataset is publicly available via [Brown's XNAT](https://xnat.bnc.brown.edu). After logging into your account, you will be able to find the **BNC Demodat 2** under the list of projects​​. This should not be confused with **BNC Demo Dataset**, which is our previous version of this dataset.&#x20;
