# Overview

LCModel can be used for automatic quantification of in vivo proton MR spectra. To learn more about LCModel, visit [their website](http://lcmodel.ca/lcmodel.shtml). The BNC has a license that enables users to use the software within the Oscar \(Brown's super computer\). LCModel works best when each user has it's own installation and points to our group's license. To get started:

* Make sure you have an [Oscar account](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0GtBE8kWJpmeG4B)
* Follow our [Installation](lcmodel.md) guide
