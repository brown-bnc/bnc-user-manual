  This guide will help you quickly set up and run your first session. You'll
  learn how to launch the app, adjust basic settings, and try out the different
  movement-based games.

# Getting Started

## Launching Motion Trainer

1. On the **desktop**, locate the **Motion Trainer** shortcut icon:
   * It will be labeled `MotionTrainer`.
2. **Double-click** the icon to launch the application.
3. When the application launches, you should see the following splash screen.
4. **Click** the arrow to continue.

## Configuring Game Settings

Next, you should be navigated to the Settings Page.  The Settings Page allows you to configure the different experimental games:&#x20;

* **Balloon Game** ‚Äì A movement-sensitivity game where users must keep their head movement within a gradually shrinking threshold.
* **Fixation Game** ‚Äì Encourages the subject to remain still and focus for a given duration.
* **Video Game** ‚Äì Plays a video file if the subject stays still; pauses if they move too much.

Each game has a few tunable parameters (like movement tolerance and duration), but for now, you can use the defaults to get started.

Press **"Done"** to begin the session after configuring your games.

## Game Selection Screen

After saving your settings and clicking **Done**, you'll arrive at the **Game Selection Screen**, where you can choose which game to run:

* **Blow Up the Balloon**\
  Inflate a balloon by pressing a button while staying still. The balloon grows while movement stays within tolerance and deflates if the subject moves too much.
* **Stay Still**\
  A fixation-style task. The subject must remain still for a fixed period to succeed.
* **Watch Video**\
  Plays a video file when the subject remains still. Movement pauses playback.

To change game parameters, click **Settings** to return to the previous configuration screen.

## üéà Blow Up the Balloon

In this game, the participant inflates a balloon by pressing a button on a handheld device (e.g., a button box). With each button press:

* The balloon **grows slightly**
* The **tolerance for movement decreases**, making it harder to stay still as the game progresses

**Objective**

* Inflate the balloon until it **pops** ‚Äî this counts as a successful trial!
* If the participant moves **outside the allowed tolerance**, the balloon **deflates** and they are given a chance to try again

**How It Works**

* The movement tolerance begins at the **‚ÄúMovement Tolerance Start‚Äù** value (set in the Settings Page)
* It gradually scales down to the **‚ÄúMovement Tolerance End‚Äù** as the balloon inflates
* Movement is monitored continuously, so the participant must press carefully and remain still

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Stay Still

In this game, the participant is shown a fixation graphic on screen and must remain completely still for a set amount of time.

**Objective**

* Stay still for the full **duration** (set via `Fixation Duration` in the Settings Page)
* If movement exceeds the allowed **tolerance** (set via `Movement Tolerance`), the trial **fails** and the participant is prompted to try again
* If they successfully remain within tolerance for the entire duration, the trial is **a success**

**How It Works**

* The fixation graphic remains visible on screen throughout the task
* A **fixed movement threshold** is used (does not change over time like in the balloon game)
* The trial ends automatically after either a success or a failure

## üì∫ Watch Video

In this game, a video (e.g., a short animated clip) plays while the participant remains still. It pauses whenever movement exceeds a configured threshold and resumes once the participant is still again.

**Objective**

* Watch the full video without interruption
* If the participant **moves too much**, the video **pauses**
* A message saying **‚ÄúStay still!‚Äù** appears as feedback
* Once the participant‚Äôs movement falls **back within the tolerance**, the video automatically resumes

**How It Works**

* The video file is selected on the **Settings Page**
* A **fixed movement tolerance** (in mm) is configured for this game
* There is also a **timeout value** ‚Äî if the participant doesn‚Äôt return to stillness within this time, the session can be stopped or retried
