  Reading DICOM files exported from the scanner or XNAT is not always intuitive.
  This script offered by the BNC aims to ease confusion by organizing the files
  in a way that is clear and consistent.

# dicomsort: a tool to organize DICOM files

Dicomsort reads information from the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) headers of each file and then renames and sorts the files alphabetically by series and slice number. It can also be used to create subdirectories for each series.&#x20;

## Accessing the Script

This script can be accessed on Oscar in the public directory: `/oscar/data/bnc/shared/scripts/oscar-scripts/`.  From there, it can be used standalone or can be integrated into larger pipelines on Oscar. Additionally, it is available for local download on the BNC's github [found here](https://github.com/brown-bnc/oscar-scripts/blob/main/dicomsort). &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This script relies on multiple AFNI commands. Before running it, ensure that AFNI is installed. On Oscar, this can be done with the command `module load afni`
{% endhint %}

## The script:&#x20;

To display the help message and see how to use the script, you can run `/oscar/data/bnc/shared/scripts/oscar-scripts/dicomsort -?` in a terminal on Oscar.

#This script use the afni programs dicom_hdr and dicom_hinfo to read header information, 
#reads the information and then renames and sorts the files alphabetically, optionally
#creating subdirectories for each series.  AFNI must be installed locally for 
#this script to work
#Written by Michael Worden
#Updated 02/07/2024 to add support for optionally creating subject and series 
#subdirectories
#Updated 03/15/2024 to name subdirectories by Series Description instead of Protocol Name
