# LC Model

LCModel can be used for automatic quantification of in vivo proton MR spectra. To learn more about LCModel, visit [their website](http://lcmodel.ca/lcmodel.shtml). The BNC has a license that enables users to use the software within Oscar (Brown's super computer). LCModel works best when each user has his/her own installation and points to our group's license. To get started:

* Make sure you have an [Oscar account](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0GtBE8kWJpmeG4B)
* Follow our [Installation](lcmodel.md) guide
