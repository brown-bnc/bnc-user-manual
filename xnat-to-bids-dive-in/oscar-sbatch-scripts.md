# Oscar SBATCH Scripts

### Batch Script (Advanced Users)

We keep up-to-date sample scripts and instructions in this repository [https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools-examples](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools-examples).&#x20;

⚠️ Do not store your password directly in scripts. You could use temporary files or environment variables. However, if you prefer typing it interactively, then using an Interactive session is the only way.
