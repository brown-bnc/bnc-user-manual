# Oscar SBATCH Scripts

✋ We highly recommend using the new [Oscar utility script](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/bnc-user-manual/xnat-to-bids-intro/using-oscar/oscar-utility-script) to export your data from XNAT and convert it to BIDS format. This script will create and submit sbatch scripts for you, making it easy to run many participants in parallel.

### Batch Script (Advanced Users)

We keep legacy sample scripts and instructions in this repository [https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools-examples](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools-examples).&#x20;

⚠️ Do not store your password directly in scripts. You could use temporary files or environment variables. However, if you prefer typing it interactively, then using an Interactive session is the only way.
