  We are continuing to expand the types of data that can be transferred to XNAT,
  and exported and converted with our XNAT2BIDS software.

# ðŸ†• Converting non-MR data&#x20;

We have recently added support for automatic export and conversion of [physiological data](physiological-data.md) (pulse and respiration) collected alongside fMRI data by the scanner, and [EEG data](eeg-data.md), collected either concurrently with fMRI data or on its own. If you collect these (or other) data types and try out our new tools, we would love your feedback on any issues or requests for additional features!
