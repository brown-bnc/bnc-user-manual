# XNAT2BIDS Software

After gathering the requirements described in the [Getting Started Section](../getting-started.md#requirements), you are ready to export your data. We maintain a python package [xnat-tools](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools) that facilitates exporting and converting your data to BIDS. The optimal way to install and run the code depends on your computation environment. The package [documentation](https://brown-bnc.github.io/xnat-tools/) explains different installation and execution methods for a general user. Many of our researchers have access to Brown's super computer [Oscar](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar). Here, we will guide you through an example of how to export your data to BIDS within Oscar's computational environment.&#x20;
