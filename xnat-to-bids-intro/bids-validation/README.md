# BIDS Validation

## BIDS Validation

After running the `xnat2bids` software, it is recommended to run the [BIDS Validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#docker-image) on your data. We provide instructions to do it programmatically, but there is also a website where you can do it interactively.

ðŸŽ‰  If you used the new [Oscar utility script](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/bnc-user-manual/xnat-to-bids-intro/using-oscar/oscar-utility-script) to export and convert your data, the BIDS validator will be run for you automatically.
