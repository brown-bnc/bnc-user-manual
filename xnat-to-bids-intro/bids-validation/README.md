# BIDS Validation

## BIDS Validation

After running the `xnat2bids` software, it is recommended to run the [BIDS Validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#docker-image) on your data. We provide instructions to do it programmatically, but there is also a website where you can do it interactively.
