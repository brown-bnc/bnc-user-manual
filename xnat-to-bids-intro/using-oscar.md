# Exporting to BIDS using Oscar

ðŸš§ This section is undergoing changes. Apologies for the inconvenience

## Interacting with Oscar

You can login to Oscar via different methods. You can [ssh using your terminal](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/ssh), you can [connect via a VNC (Virtual Desktop) Client](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/vnc), or if your editor can connect to remote servers, [you can connect via your favorite IDE](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/remote-ide) (VSCode is great!). If this is your first time using Oscar and you are new to unix command line, we recommend connecting via the VNC client.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you connect to Oscar via SSH, you arrive at a login node, we will need to wrap our commands in a batch file or use an interactive session. You can learn more about running jobs in the Oscar [docs](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/submitting-jobs/shared-machine). Please **remember to not run processing on the login nodes**
{% endhint %}

## Installating XNAT2BIDS

**ðŸŽ‰ Skip -** You will not need to install any software. We keep a Singularity image of the most recent tagged release of [`xnat-tools`](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools)in Oscar. If this is the first time that you here the word `Singularity image` don't worry, we will expand more on that soon.

## Running XNAT2BIDS

The xnat-tools package provides a convenience `xnat2bids` script to facilitate data export and conversion to BIDS. The script is documented [here](https://brown-bnc.github.io/xnat-tools/1.0.0/xnat2bids/), and the package documentation is useful for knowing the the full list of inputs and defaults. We will demostrate how to call that script within Oscar using the BNC's demo dataset.&#x20;

### 0. Summary of commands

Before getting started, we have grouped all the commands executed in this page for your reference

```
interact -n 2 -t 01:00:00 -m 8g
version=v1.0.6
bids_root_dir=${HOME}/xnat-exports
mkdir -m 775 ${bids_root_dir} || echo "Output directory already exists"
simg=/gpfs/data/bnc/simgs/brownbnc/xnat-tools-${version}.sif
XNAT_USER=${USER} 
XNAT_SESSION="XNAT_E00008" 
singularity exec --contain --bind ${bids_root_dir} ${simg} \
    xnat2bids ${XNAT_SESSION} ${bids_root_dir} \
    -u ${XNAT_USER} \
    -i 1
```



### 1. Start an interactive session

Here we start the software as an **interactive** job of one hour.

#### 1.1 VNC&#x20;

Connecting via VNC is a friendly way to request an graphical interactive session in Brown's supercomputer - Oscar. When you connected via the VNC client, you will be asked to specify the necessary resources. For this example, you can choose the basic job. Once logged in,  you are already inside an interactive session.&#x20;

![Selecting resources for VNC session](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

At this point, simply open the terminal

![VNC Desktop. Green arrow point to Terminal icon to be launched](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

#### 1.2 SSH&#x20;

To connect via SSH, you type. If this is your first time connecting vis ssh, you will be asked to trust the remote computer (Oscar), your Brown credentials, and unless you are connected to VPN, you will be requered to use DUO.

```
ssh username@ssh.ccv.brown.edu
```

At this point you arrive at a login node. We will need to start an interactive section/job by typing

```
interact -n 2 -t 01:00:00 -m 8g
```

### 2. Define variables

We will now define a series of shell variables that will allow us to keep our commands more reusable. This will also be useful if you later decide to move to [batch scripts](../xnat-to-bids-dive-in/oscar-sbatch-scripts.md), which provide a better way to run jobs simultaneustly and without constant interaction.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
When defining shell Variables, make sure to not have any spaces in the variable name, the assigend value or in  between the equal sign

The variable will only be defined during the current shell session. If you close your terminal or interactive session, the variables will need to be redefined
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to copy-paste from this docs to VNC, click on the Copy to Clipboard Icon on the right of the code snippets. To paste into the terminal in the VNC you will need to use the right click of your mouse
{% endhint %}

#### 2.1 Define the version of `xnat-tools`

We recommend using the latest available version. You can get a list of the relased versions [here](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools/releases). The version specified here is likely teh latest we have tested. If you test a newer version, we'd love your contributions to this documentation!

```
version=v1.0.6
```

#### &#x20;2.2 Set up paths

**BIDS Root directory**

This is the directory where data will be written to. If the directory does ot exist then it needs to be created.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For this sample walkthrough, you can use the path exactly as shown below. The `${USER}` variable is a systemwide variable and it is automatically interpreted as your OSCAR user. However, onece you are using your own data, you should export to directories in your PI's data folder, which typically follows the pattern `/gpfs/data/<PI oscar user>`
{% endhint %}

```
bids_root_dir=${HOME}/xnat-exports
mkdir -m 775 ${bids_root_dir} || echo "Output directory already exists"
```

**Path to Singularity Image**&#x20;

This is maintained by bnc and we will be pointing to the version defined above

```
simg=/gpfs/data/bnc/simgs/brownbnc/xnat-tools-${version}.sif
```

#### XNAT USER and SESSION&#x20;

Typically, your XNAT user is the same as your Brown user. Finding the session ID was explained in [an earlier section](getting-started.md#requirements). In this example we use leverage the `$USER` variable to sert your XNAT user. This is possible because both oscar username and XNAT username are typically the same (i.e your Brown username). For the session, we are using the accession number for participant 001 of the demo dataset

```
XNAT_USER=${USER} #only change if oscar user doesn't match XNAT user (rare)
XNAT_SESSION="XNAT24_E00002" #ACCESSION of 001 participant in sample data
```

### 3. Understanding Singularity Containers&#x20;

In the following section we will demostrate how to run our software. Instead of directly installing the Python package `xnat-tools` we are going to run it from inside a **container**, which we have been refering to as "the singularity image/container". If you are new to containers, in a nutshell, a container allows for packaging all OS and package dependencies together so it can run in any computer. Docker containers have become very popular, you can learn a bit more about them [here](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). Singularity is a type of container that has specialized on running on shared HPC clusters. You can learn little more about Singularity [here](https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/master/introduction.html#why-use-singularity). We referred to docker conatiners and singularity containers interchangably, as they can easily be converted from one fromat to another.

In the specific case of `xnat-tools` , the wrapping container has `Python` , `dcm2niix` and `heudiconv` installed which are all neededby our software. The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/brown-bnc/xnat-tools/blob/master/Dockerfile) for `xnat-tools` provide some insight into how containers are built.

**Understanding the file system of a container**

Containers have their own file system, which is completely independent and isolated from the host where the container is run

{% hint style="info" %}
Because a container does not have the same directory structure as the host, we have to remember that paths like `/gpfs/data/<PI>` only exist in Oscar, but not inside the container
{% endhint %}

**Sharing paths between a container and the host computer (OSCAR)**

If we want a directory/file that exists in OSCAR to be availabe inside our container, we need to tell Singularity that. We do so, by **binding a volume. This achieved by passing the flag `--bind <oscar_path>:<container_path>`.** If we want the path inside the container to be exactly as the path in OSCAR, we can ommit the destination path, that is `--bind <oscar_path>`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `--bind` flag can also be passed as `-B`
{% endhint %}

**Singularity default behavior when it comes to sharing paths and environment variables**

While generally speaking, a container is mostly isolated from the host, there are few exceptions. And these exceptions and default behaviors are different for Singularity and Docker. We will focus on Singularity rules here. By default Singularity binds the following locations

```
 $HOME
 /sys:/sys
 /proc:/proc
 /tmp:/tmp
 /var/tmp:/var/tmp
 /etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf
 /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd
 $PWD. 
```

**(Pro-Tip):** Generally speaking, the default behavior of Signularity works great, sometimes however, some of the configurations included in your `$HOME` or environment variables set in you `$HOME/.bashrc` may create conflicts. Singularity offers several flags that can be passed to further isolate the container from the local host. These include

```
--no-home
--contain
--containall
--no-mount
```

If you see such flags in our examples and want to learn more about them visit [this docs](https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/master/bind\_paths\_and\_mounts.html)

### 4. Running the executable

#### Printing the help

Let's start by making sure that we can successfully run our `xnat2bids` executable inside the container.

```
singularity exec ${simg} xnat2bids --help
```

Lets expand on the above command:

`singularity`: invokes singularity

`exec`: tells singularity we will be executing a command, in this case the command is `xnat2bids`

`${simg}`: is the singularity image/container that we will be using. We are passing the value of the variable we defined in Step 2. In our case, this is interpreted/evaluated as `/gpfs/data/bnc/simgs/brownbnc/xnat-tools-v1.0.5.sif`&#x20;

`xnat2bids`: is the command to be executed, and it is followed by any necessary inputs. In this case `--help`

If the above command is successful, you'll be seeing the following output in your terminal

```
Usage: xnat2bids [OPTIONS] SESSION BIDS_ROOT_DIR

  Export DICOM images from an XNAT experiment to a BIDS compliant directory

Arguments:
  SESSION        XNAT Session ID, that is the Accession # for an experiment.
                 [required]

  BIDS_ROOT_DIR  Root output directory for exporting the files  [required]

Options:
  -u, --user TEXT                 XNAT User
  -p, --pass TEXT                 XNAT Password
  -h, --host TEXT                 XNAT'sURL  [default:
                                  https://xnat.bnc.brown.edu]

  -S, --session-suffix TEXT       Suffix of the session for BIDS defaults to
                                  01.              This will produce a session
                                  label of sess-01.              You likely
                                  only need to change the default for multi-
                                  session studies  [default: 01]

  -f, --bidsmap-file TEXT         Bidsmap JSON file to correct sequence names
                                  [default: ]

  -i, --includeseq INTEGER        Include this sequence only, this flag can
                                  specify multiple times  [default: ]

  -s, --skipseq INTEGER           Exclude this sequence, can be specified
                                  multiple times  [default: ]

  --log-id TEXT                   ID or suffix to append to logfile. If empty,
                                  current date is used  [default:
                                  07-14-2021-08-51-00]

  -v, --verbose                   Verbose level. This flag can be specified
                                  multiple times to increase verbosity
                                  [default: 0]

  --overwrite                     Remove directories where prior results for
                                  this session/participant  [default: False]

  --cleanup / --no-cleanup        Remove xnat-export folder and move logs to
                                  derivatives/xnat/logs  [default: False]

  --install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Install completion for the specified shell.
  --show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Show completion for the specified shell, to
                                  copy it or customize the installation.

  --help                          Show this message and exit.

```

#### Running XNAT2BIDS (test only on one series)

The following command will run the executable `xnat2bids` (via singularity) command to extract DICOMs from XNAT and export to BIDS.&#x20;

```
singularity exec --contain --bind ${bids_root_dir} ${simg} \
    xnat2bids ${XNAT_SESSION} ${bids_root_dir} \
    -u ${XNAT_USER} \
    -i 1
```

Once again lets expand on the command above:

`singularity`: invokes singularity

`exec`: tells singularity we will be executing a command, in this case the command is `xnat2bids`

`${simg}`: is the singularity image/container that we will be using. We are passing the value of the variable we defined in Step 2. In our case, this is interpreted/evaluated as `/gpfs/data/bnc/simgs/brownbnc/xnat-tools-v1.0.5.sif`&#x20;

`xnat2bids`: is the command to be executed, and it is followed by any necessary inputs. In this case we are passing it the possitional arguments `${XNAT_SESSION}` and `${bids_root_dir}` and we are also passing the arguments `-u ${XNAT_USER}` and `-i 1`. The `-i` is asking to only process the first sequence. For a full list of inputs, please see the  [xnat-tools documentation](https://brown-bnc.github.io/xnat-tools/1.0.0/xnat2bids/)

After running the command, you'll be asked to interactively type your Brown/XNAT password.

A successful run will print out the following output

#### Running XNAT2BIDS (full dataset)

After confirming that XNAT2BIDS is behaving as expected we will run the program on the full dataset. To do so, we envoke it as follows

```
singularity exec --contain --bind ${bids_root_dir} ${simg} \
    xnat2bids ${XNAT_SESSION} ${bids_root_dir} \
    -u ${XNAT_USER} \
    -s 6
```

The command above is almost identical to the one executed earlier, the only new argument is `-s 6` . In this instance we are running `xnat2bids` on all scan sequences, excepts series 6. Series 6 corresponds to a multi-echo MPRAGE and it's typically not used in BIDS apps. We only export the RMS of the echos (#7). We explain this a bit more in the [BIDS Ready Protocols](../xnat/bids-compliant-protocols.md#important-considerations) section. After successful execution, the last line of your log, should be

```
INFO: PROCESSING DONE: {'subject': '001', 'outdir': '/users/<your-user>/xnat-exports/bnc/study-demodat/bids/', 'session': '01'}
```

### 5. Validate the BIDS output

After successfully running `xnat2bids` you'll need to make sure that BIDS validation passes. This process is explained in the [BIDS Validation Section](bids-validation/)
